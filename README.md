# DeFi Hack Case Studies

This repository contains concise case studies of several high-profile Decentralized Finance (DeFi) hacks. Each study captures the key facts about the exploit, identifies the underlying vulnerability, reconstructs the attacker's path, highlights observable on-chain indicators and distills the lessons learned. These examples are intended for educational purposes and to help defenders recognise and prevent similar attacks in the future.
